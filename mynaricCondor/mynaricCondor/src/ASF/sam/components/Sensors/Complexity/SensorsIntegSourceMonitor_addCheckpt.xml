   <!-- ===================================================================

    The write_log element value is used for execution of commands in this

    file, not the log errors flag set in SourceMonitor's options dialog.

    If this element is missing, command progress and errors will be written

    to the SourceMonitor log file.

    =================================================================== -->

 

   <write_log>true</write_log>

 

   <!-- ===============================================================

    This command is typical for the case where a project exists and you

    want to create a new checkpoint and export its metrics.

   ================================================================ -->

 

   <command>

 

       <project_file>C:\myWorks\mynaric\Application\embedded\mynaricApp_Embedded\mynaricCondor\mynaricCondor\src\ASF\sam\components\Sensors\Complexity\sensorsIntegration.smp</project_file>

 

       <!-- ===============================================================

        If you do not specify a checkpoint name, a name will be created for

        you in the form "CheckpointN" where N is the next higher number not

        already present in an auto-generated checkpoint name in this

        project.

       ================================================================ -->

 

       <export>

           <export_file>C:\myWorks\mynaric\Application\embedded\mynaricApp_Embedded\mynaricCondor\mynaricCondor\src\ASF\sam\components\Sensors\Complexity\dump.xml</export_file>

           <export_type>2 (checkpoint details as XML)</export_type>

       </export>




 

       <!-- ===============================================================

        When the </command> tag is encountered, the checkpoint is created,

        the metrics for all files in the new checkpoint are exported as

        XML, and then the new checkpoint is deleted from the project.

        However, if any errors occur in the command's specification, an

        error message will be logged (if logging is enabled) and the

        execution of the command will be aborted.

       ================================================================ -->

 

   </command>
